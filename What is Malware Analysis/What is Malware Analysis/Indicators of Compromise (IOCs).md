# Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of information or patterns that cybersecurity professionals and organizations use to detect and identify potential security incidents, breaches, or malicious activities within their computer networks or systems. IOCs serve as valuable forensic artifacts that help security teams recognize abnormal or unauthorized activities and respond to security threats effectively. These indicators can take various forms and provide clues about potential security incidents. Common types of IOCs include:

1. **File-Based IOCs**:
    - **File Hashes**: MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes of files, which help identify known malicious files or verify file integrity.
    - **File Names**: Suspicious or known malicious file names or paths.
    - **File Sizes**: Unusually large or small file sizes that may indicate malicious activity.
    - **File Extensions**: Non-standard or suspicious file extensions.
    - **Digital Signatures**: Unsigned or invalid digital signatures on executables and other files.
    - **File Locations**: Files located in unusual or unauthorized directories.
2. **Network-Based IOCs**:
    - **IP Addresses**: Suspicious or known malicious IP addresses used by attackers or command and control (C2) servers.
    - **Domain Names**: Malicious or suspicious domains used for communication or hosting malicious content.
    - **URLs**: Specific URLs associated with phishing, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
    - **DNS Queries**: Abnormal or unusual DNS queries that may indicate a security threat.
    - **User Agents**: Unusual user-agent strings in HTTP requests.
    - **Port Activity**: Unusual or unauthorized network port activity, such as unexpected openings or closures.
3. **Registry and System Configuration IOCs**:
    - **Registry Keys and Values**: Suspicious or unauthorized entries in the Windows Registry.
    - **Startup Entries**: Unusual or unauthorized entries in system startup configuration.
    - **Service and Process Names**: Malicious or suspicious service or process names.
4. **Behavioral IOCs**:
    - **Behavioral Patterns**: Anomalies in system or network behavior, such as an increase in failed login attempts, unusual user activity, or unexpected data exfiltration.
    - **Command and Scripting Activity**: Unusual or suspicious commands, scripts, or PowerShell activity on systems.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Unusual changes in user privileges or elevated access.
5. **Email-Based IOCs**:
    - **Email Addresses**: Known malicious email addresses used for phishing and spam.
    - **Email Subjects and Content**: Suspicious or malicious email subjects, attachments, or URLs.
    - **Email Headers**: Unusual or malicious email headers.
6. **Malware Artifacts**:
    - **Malware Signatures**: Unique characteristics or artifacts of known malware strains, such as specific code snippets or registry entries.
    - **Malware Persistence Mechanisms**: Techniques used by malware to maintain persistence on a system.
7. **YARA Rules**: Custom or publicly available YARA rules, which are used to identify patterns and strings specific to certain types of malware.
8. **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Subscriptions to threat intelligence services that provide lists of known IOCs related to specific threats or threat actors.

Using these IOCs, security teams can create rules and alerts within their security systems to automatically detect and respond to potential security incidents. IOCs are valuable in proactive threat detection, incident response, and threat intelligence sharing among organizations to collectively strengthen cybersecurity defenses.
