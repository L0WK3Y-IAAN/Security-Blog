# Types of Malware Analysis

Malware analysis involves the systematic examination of malicious software to understand its inner workings, behavior, and potential impact. There are various techniques and methods used in malware analysis, depending on the objectives and the level of detail required. Here are common techniques of malware analysis:

1. **Static Analysis**:
    - **File Analysis**: Examine the malware's binary or source code without executing it. This includes reviewing the file's structure, strings, headers, and embedded data.
    - **Code Disassembly**: Disassemble the executable code to study the assembly instructions. Tools like IDA Pro and OllyDbg are commonly used for this purpose.
    - **Strings Analysis**: Analyze the strings within the malware, as they may contain clues about its functionality and intentions.
    - **Header Analysis**: Examine the headers of executable files to identify their file format and potentially discover any packers or obfuscation techniques.
    - **Behavioral Indicators**: Look for behavioral indicators in the code, such as API calls, system functions, and function calls, to understand how the malware interacts with the system.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**:
    - **Execution in a Sandbox**: Run the malware in a controlled and isolated environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior during execution. This includes monitoring file system changes, network communications, and registry modifications.
    - **Behavioral Analysis**: Observe and document the actions the malware takes, such as file creation, registry key changes, and network traffic patterns. Behavioral analysis provides insight into the malware's functionality.
    - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Capture and analyze network traffic generated by the malware to identify communication with command and control (C2) servers and data exfiltration attempts.
3. **Advanced Analysis**:
    - Advanced malware analysis goes beyond the basic techniques and tools used to understand the inner workings of malicious software. It is a more sophisticated and in-depth approach that is often employed by cybersecurity professionals, incident responders, and security researchers to dissect and analyze complex, evasive, and advanced malware threats. For performing advanced malware analysis, disassemblers and debuggers are used.  The insights gained from advanced analysis are invaluable for developing effective countermeasures, improving security, and enhancing the overall understanding of emerging cyber threats.

Malware analysis is a multifaceted process, and the specific techniques used may vary depending on the objectives of the analysis and the tools available. A combination of these techniques is often required to gain a comprehensive understanding of a given malware sample.
